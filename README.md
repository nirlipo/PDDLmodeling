# PDDL modelling assignments 

This repository has been created to share a collection of PDDL assignments integrated with the [editor.planning.domains IDE](editor.planning.domains) and [Planimation](https://planimation.planning.domains/). 

The first assignment was developed in 2020. If you add more assignments to teach PDDL Modeling, please share the link so I can add it, or do a Pull Request.
